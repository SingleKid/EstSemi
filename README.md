# EstSemi
The seminar project of course 629: estimation with colored noise

#This project is created to:
##1. evaluate the result of kalman filtering with colored noise and white noise.
##2. evaluate the improvement of colored noise kalman filtering.
##3. test the performance of them with different parameters.

# Those parameters include:
##1. Q(i,i)
##2. R(i,i)
##3. Noise strength
##4. Colored factor. (for first order gauss-markov colored noise.)
