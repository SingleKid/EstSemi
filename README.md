# EstSemi
The seminar project of course 629: estimation with colored noise

# This project is created to:
## 1. evaluate the result of kalman filtering with colored noise and white noise.
## 2. evaluate the improvement of colored noise kalman filtering.
## 3. test the performance of them with different parameters.

# Those parameters include:
## 1. Q(i,i)
## 2. R(i,i)
## 3. Noise strength
## 4. Colored factor. (for first order gauss-markov colored noise.)
